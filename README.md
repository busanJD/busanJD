# Joydeep Das 👋

A second-year Master's student at the School of Physics, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.

### About Me

I am currently pursuing my Master’s project on **Spectro-polarimetry of Gamma Ray Bursts** under the supervision of Dr. Shabnam Iyyani.

My primary academic interests lie in **Extragalactic Astronomy**, with a specific focus on **Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)** and **multiwavelength studies** of galaxy formation and evolution, with an emphasis on **radio bands**. I am passionate about contributing to the upcoming **Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Project** and am also committed to sharing my learning through citizen science outreach.

### 🔭 My Goals

I am actively seeking a PhD position in **Extragalactic Astronomy, Multiwavelength Astronomy, or Galaxy Formation and Evolution** to further my research and contributions in these fields.

### 🔬 Projects

* **Star Formation Rate in Resolved Galaxy** - NGC1427A

* **Light Curve analysis & Background modelling** of GRB110721A

* **Spectral study** of high-Z galaxies from JWST-NIRSpec data

* **Galaxies with Active black holes** through Multiwavelength Data and Citizen Science

### 🎨 Hobbies

When I'm not studying the stars, I enjoy:

* **Playing Badminton** 🏸

* **Painting** 🎨

* **Essay writing** ✍️

* **Meme-making** (it definitely counts!) 😂
